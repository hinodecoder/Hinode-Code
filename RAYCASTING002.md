**Raycasting Game in C - 2**

![Corridor, 1, screenshot](/data/corridor002.png)

Today's post will be short. I've just added texture mapping and texture loading from external file using upng library for C. As I've mentioned before: this code is mess for now. Please don't use it.

Code is strongly based on Pikuma Online Course about Raycasting - it is almost exactly the same for now but will be modified later when I finish making a game for jam.

Also: I've added repository for that code. So if anyone wants to follow along, here it is: [https://github.com/hinodecoder/edgar.git](https://github.com/hinodecoder/edgar.git)
